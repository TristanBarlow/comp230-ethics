\section{Introduction}
In the games industry, the term "Crunch" or "Crunch Time" is used to describe periods of extreme workload \cite[p. 468]{edholm2017crunch}. Opinion pieces written by developers, who have experienced Crunch, describe an environment that limits or removes activities that do not contribute to the game. This includes but is not limited to "family and even food"\cite{schreier_2017}. In this essay, the author will explore how this environment will affect the mental states of the employees involved. By using research theory and case studies from the games industry, we will explore how poor mental health can affect the design process. In addition, we will use examples from other industries to further support our insights. The author aims to provide guidance on how to approach Crunch in a way that will least affect the mental well-being of the employees involved. In so doing, avoiding the possible negative ramifications to the final product.

\section{Disscussion}
The development cycle of a product, can be a smooth process that does not require crunch. As a product reaches the end of development, often features that were advertised are buggy or missing entirely. 
During a study done in 2016 it was reported that 65\%  of  industry professionals indcated that their job involved Crunch\cite[p.20]{weststarlegault2016}.
