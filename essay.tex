\section{Introduction}
In the games industry, the term "Crunch" or "Crunch Time" is used to describe periods of extreme workload \cite[p. 468]{edholm2017crunch}. Opinion pieces written by developers who have experience Crunch describe an environment that limits or removes activities that do not contribute to the game. This includes but is not limited to "family and even food"\cite{schreier_2017}.
