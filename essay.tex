\section{Introduction}
In the games industry, the term "Crunch" or "Crunch Time" is used to describe periods of extreme workload \cite[p. 468]{edholm2017crunch}. Opinion pieces written by developers, who have experienced Crunch, describe an environment that limits or removes activities that do not contribute to the game. This includes but is not limited to "family and even food"\cite{schreier_2017}. In this essay, the author will explore how this environment will affect the mental states of the employees involved. By using research theory and case studies from the games industry, we will explore how poor mental health can affect the design process. In addition, we will use examples from other industries to further support our insights. The author aims to provide insight how Crunch may affect the mental state of the developers. This will allow the reader to better understand the consequences of Crunch, reducing the negative ramifications to the final product.

\section{Disscussion}
The development cycle of a product, can be a smooth process that does not require crunch. However,  overscoping, unforseen barriers or poor planning may cause the project to fall behind schedual. If the team wants deal with the remaining bugs, late feature requests and last minute modifications they have to start putting in over-time, thus we get crunch\cite{onlineWebl}\cite{edholm2017crunch}. During a satisfaction survey in 2016, it was reported that 65\%  of industry professionals indcated that their job involved Crunch with an extra 32\%  saying their jobs "did require periods of long hours" it "was just not called 'crunch'".\cite[p.20]{weststarlegault2016}. From this survey, it is clear that more than half of the industry professionals experience this kind of overtime. The first affect of these conditions we will discuss is mental fatigue.

Mental fatigue is defined as the difficulty in starting or sustaining voluntary activities\cite{chaudhuri2004fatigue}. This kind of fatigue can be caused by a sustained mental load in otherwise healthy humans\cite {mizuno2011mental}. The author argues that all professions within the games industry if performed to industry standard, constitute a significant mental load. The IGDA reported that during crunch 35\% of employees reported a 50-59 hour working week, a further 28\% reported 60-69 and a smaller 13\% reported 70 or more hours. According to the UK government, it is illegal to work over 48 hours a week averaged over 17 weeks, with acceptions\cite{maximumweeklyhours}. Arguably, by working well over the suggested 48 hours per week limit, performing cognitive intense loads as found in game development, will cause employees to get mental fatigue. It has been found that mentally fatigued workers have trouble keeping their attention focused and that they're distracted easily\cite{bartlett1943ferrier}.
